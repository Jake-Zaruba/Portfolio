        <strong>This website started my journey</strong> into web development.
        My goal with this project was to create a unique and tasteful wedding
        website that was unlike any of the many wedding photography websites I
        had seen throughout my career. I wanted there to be minimal use of text
        and whitespace, and as much use of my actual wedding photos as possible
        without being overwhelming or busy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p2" class="paragraph-text">
        This was a challenge as I had to find minimal, simple and moody photos
        while also making sure to follow best practices in image compression and
        accessibility. Through this, I learned a great deal about aria labels
        and alternatives to alt-text so as to describe whole galleries rather
        than spamming every individual photo with the same alt-text. This was
        also my first encounter with observation observers which helped me get
        comfortable writing my own javascript functions for the very first time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p3" class="paragraph-text">
        I created the first iteration of this site in 2021 after officially
        shutting my business down. I later decided to revamp it with a greater
        use of javascript to escape tutorial hell and create real, working,
        reactive elements. The first element I created with this goal in mind
        was the fullscreen slider in the hero section. I've learned a great deal
        since creating that landing page, but at the time I was excstatic when I
        first saw it working as intended.
      </p>

      <p id="p4" class="paragraph-text">
        <strong>The wordpress template</strong> I began my wedding business with
        in 2015 had a
        <em>nearly</em>
        fullscreen slider that I didn't know how to customize at the time, and
        left about 10% of the screen with whitespace. Because of this, I wasn't
        able to use many of my favorite photos. After creating my new fullscreen
        slider, it felt incredible to see my photos diplayed the way I had
        intended for the past six years.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p5" class="paragraph-text">
        This project not only sparked my obsession for learning web design and
        development, but also allowed me to write my first lines of code outside
        of the safe and easy tutorial environments I had been. After building
        several static websites, I finally had a dynamic website that reacted to
        the user's input. I instantly wanted to know more about javascript, and
        after this project, I dove deeper into learning how web development.

      <img

        class="blog-img"

      <p id="p5" class="paragraph-text">
        <strong>Two of the biggest challenges</strong> I faced while creating
        this website were performance and accessibility. It was a great project
        to force myself to learn some best practices for labeling photos and
        photo sets, as well lazy loading photos and finding optimal image
        compression methods. Lazy loading helped with performance, but the size
        of my photos were still weighing the load speed down. After a good
        amount of trial and error, I was able to find a sweet spot where I could
        preserve my image quality without facing long loading times on my
        website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p6" class="paragraph-text">
        Another big challenge I ran into was maintaining a creative and
        appealing photo layout throughout each page while adding media queries
        for smaller viewports. This project almost immediately showed me why
        it's crucial to begin building a website with a mobile first approach. I
        did finally get to a point where I was pleased with the mobile layout,
        but I learned my lesson and began my next site with the mobile first
        approach by building out the mockup in Figma with mobile viewports.

      <p id="p7" class="paragraph-text">
        While building this site, I learned that less is sometimes more with
        page animations. I had heard this repeated in my courses but didn't
        appreciate the importance of this idea until I had animations on every
        aspect of my website. When I revamped this site, I toned it down quite a
        bit and learned the value of subtlety. When an animation or interactive
        component did appear, it was much more visually appealing as opposed to
        trying to keep up with moving elements all throughout the website.

      <p id="p8" class="paragraph-text">
        <strong>My main takeaway</strong> from this particular project was that
        I absolutely love web development. I had used javascript on a real-world
        project for the first time, and I wanted to jump right into my next
        project with a much heavier use of javascript to further my
        understanding of it. Before doing so, I went back to my online courses
        and spent another two weeks buried in javascript fundamentals. I wanted
        to write code with intention and not by copying the same small functions
        over and over as I did while using intersection observers on my wedding
        website. After two weeks of 10-14 hour days of studying and practicing,
        I was ready to begin my next project.
