        <strong>This simple app changed everything for me.</strong> Up to this
        point, I felt comfortable writing <em>some</em> code, but it felt
        forced. I wasn't sure what to use or when to use it, other than very
        simple animations or events. I still felt intimidated by APIs, hadn't
        used promises, and was terrified of callbacks. Over the past year I'd
        read countless times that one day this would all 'click' for me, but
        what did that mean? Would I know when this happens? It turned out that
        the answer was yes, and I'd find that answer just a few lines into this
        app.

        As I began this project, I was following a tutorial. I figured I'd just
        follow along and hopefully catch on to a few main aspects of the coding,
        then move on to my next project. For some reason, as I typed out the
        first few lines of code alongside the tutorial, everything suddenly
        clicked. After fetching one API and displaying its contents in the
        console, I closed the tutorial, deleted that code, started over, and
        would then build the entire app from scratch. Some of the code was
        redundant, some was a bit messy, but it was mine. And I hadn't felt this
        excited in years.

        My plan was to make this a minimal app. I wanted it to display the
        weather, perhaps on a grey background, and that would be it. But as I
        understood more about what I was coding, all I wanted to do was add more
        custom features. At this point, I decided to download Figma to get a
        grasp on creating mockups. I started learning the pen tool, creating
        custom shapes for the whole app, and then translating that mockup into a
        real web page. Once I had the layout coded, I knew I wanted to add
        additional features like a forecast, custom changing weather icons, and
        an advanced weather box.

        I was finally using many of the things I had <em>learned</em> but hadn't
        used in practice. Destructuring arrays and objects, looping through
        arrays, working with dates, times, and coordinates, and so much more. I
        really had to problem solve to create all of the features I wanted. This
        would result in periods of brainstorming before doing any actual coding,
        and intorduced me to flowcharts that I would use to plan out new
        features. Breaking the problems down this way made complicated features
        much easier to write out, and saved me from a lot of wasted time as
        opposed to my strictly trial and error approach I had been using up to
        this point.

        After a good amount of testing and debugging, my app was done. I decided
        to learn about PWAs and turned this app into one which I installed on my
        work computer as my new weather app. It was just a simple weather app,
        but I was so proud of what I had created. I couldn't wait for my next
        project, but I was now also well aware that I needed to begin learning a
        framework alongside my vanilla JS studies. I wanted to cut down on the
        boiler plate code and create code that would be reusable. I dove into
        Vue and Svelte and immediately understood the value they could bring to
        large scale projects.

        <strong>Two of the biggest challenges</strong> I faced while creating
        this website were performance and accessibility. It was a great project
        to force myself to learn some best practices for labeling photos and
        photo sets, as well lazy loading photos and finding optimal image
        compression methods. Lazy loading helped with performance, but the size
        of my photos were still weighing the load speed down. After a good
        amount of trial and error, I was able to find a sweet spot where I could
        preserve my image quality without facing long loading times on my
        website.

        Another big challenge I ran into was maintaining a creative and
        appealing photo layout throughout each page while adding media queries
        for smaller viewports. This project almost immediately showed me why
        it's crucial to begin building a website with a mobile first approach. I
        did finally get to a point where I was pleased with the mobile layout,
        but I learned my lesson and began my next site with the mobile first
        approach by building out the mockup in Figma with mobile viewports.

        While building this site, I learned that less is sometimes more with
        page animations. I had heard this repeated in my courses but didn't
        appreciate the importance of this idea until I had animations on every
        aspect of my website. When I revamped this site, I toned it down quite a
        bit and learned the value of subtlety. When an animation or interactive
        component did appear, it was much more visually appealing as opposed to
        trying to keep up with moving elements all throughout the website.

        <strong>My main takeaway</strong> from this particular project was that
        I absolutely love web development. I had used javascript on a real-world
        project for the first time, and I wanted to jump right into my next
        project with a much heavier use of javascript to further my
        understanding of it. Before doing so, I went back to my online courses
        and spent another two weeks buried in javascript fundamentals. I wanted
        to write code with intention and not by copying the same small functions
        over and over as I did while using intersection observers on my wedding
        website. After two weeks of 10-14 hour days of studying and practicing,
        I was ready to begin my next project.
