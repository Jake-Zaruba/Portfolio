        <strong>This simple app changed everything for me.</strong> Up to this
        point, I felt comfortable writing <em>some</em> code, but it felt
        forced. I wasn't sure what to use or when to use it, other than very
        simple animations or events. I still felt intimidated by APIs, hadn't
        used promises, and was terrified of callbacks. Over the past year I'd
        read countless times that one day this would all 'click' for me, but
        what did that mean? Would I know when this happens? It turned out that
        the answer was yes, and I'd find that answer just a few lines into this
        app.

      <p id="p2" class="paragraph-text">
        As I began this project, I was following a tutorial. I figured I'd just
        follow along and hopefully catch on to a few main aspects of the coding,
        then move on to my next project. For some reason, as I typed out the
        first few lines of code alongside the tutorial, everything suddenly
        clicked. After fetching one API and displaying its contents in the
        console, I closed the tutorial, deleted that code, started over, and
        would then build the entire app from scratch. Some of the code was
        redundant, some was a bit messy, but it was mine. And I hadn't felt this
        excited in years.

        My plan was to make this a minimal app. I wanted it to display the
        weather, perhaps on a grey background, and that would be it. But as I
        understood more about what I was coding, all I wanted to do was add more
        custom features. At this point, I decided to download Figma to get a
        grasp on creating mockups. I started learning the pen tool, created
        custom shapes for the whole app, and then translated that mockup into
        code. Once I had the layout coded, I knew I wanted to add additional
        features like a forecast, custom changing weather icons, and an advanced
        weather box. My website looked identical to my mockups, and I couldn't
        wait to begin the programming.

        I was finally using many of the things I had <em>learned</em> but hadn't
        used in practice. Destructuring arrays and objects, looping through
        arrays, working with dates, times, and coordinates, and so much more. I
        really had to problem solve to create all of the features I wanted. This
        would result in periods of brainstorming before doing any actual coding,
        and introduced me to flowcharts that I would use to plan out new
        features. Breaking the problems down this way made complicated features
        much easier to write out, and saved me from a lot of wasted time as
        opposed to my strictly trial and error approach I had been using up to
        this point.

        After a good amount of testing and debugging, my app was done. I decided
        to learn about PWAs and turned this app into one which I installed on my
        work computer as my new weather app. It was just a simple weather app,
        but I was so proud of what I had created. I couldn't wait for my next
        project, but I was now also well aware that I needed to begin learning a
        framework alongside my vanilla JS studies. I wanted to cut down on the
        redundant, repeated code and create code that would be reusable. I dove
        into Vue and Svelte and immediately understood the value they could
        bring to large scale projects.

        <img

          src="/img/weather-blog-img-5.png"

        <strong>The biggest challenge</strong> I encountered with this project
        was finally needing to debug. I would 'finish' a feature and it'd look
        great...for a few hours. Whether it was a miscalculation with the time
        conversion function I had written, or something in the API I hadn't
        accounted for, I found myself debugging often. And I loved it! I had so
        much fun creating this app, and I was excited any time I had the chance
        to re-write or simplify my code as it lead to me further understanding
        how all the moving parts interacted with (and sometimes broke) each
        other. This not only strengthened my ability to write new code, but also
        helped me to code cautiously so as to work in harmony with all of the
        other features within the app.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p6" class="paragraph-text">
        The other main challenge I faced was creating a pleasant UX on mobile
        devices. Auto-scrolling, keyboard pop-ups blocking elements, etc. all
        gave me the opportunity to brainstorm some new features to aid in a
        pleasant mobile experience. One example would be the page auto-scrolling
        when entering a city in the search bar. The keyboard would force the
        page to scroll down, which was fine, but it left the user at the bottom
        of the page after entering the search. Because of this, the user would
        then have to scroll back up to see the main weather display. I addressed
        this by adding a simple back-to-top function to the search icon. The
        result was a nice and smooth scroll that avoided hiding any information
        on the page. Tackling these problems to improve the UX felt great, and I
        was excited to see what other UX issues I could improve on.

        <strong>The biggest takeaway</strong> from this project was that I
        <em>can</em> do this. A lot of my fears and insecurities were squashed
        the second I cleared the tutorial code and began writing it out myself.
        I realized that I do understand how fetching APIs works, I can write my
        own functions that go beyond surface level, and that I am able to locate
        bugs and fix them myself. This boost in confidence led me to jump right
        into Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which I'm learning now.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p8" class="paragraph-text">
        One other takeaway was that planning is key. From using Figma to create
        a mockup for the layout to using flowcharts to plan the code out, I
        found the whole process to be much more manageable with this approach.
        Figma and flowcharts are now a part of each one of my new projects, and
        I find myself creating and learning much more efficiently while
        debugging far less often. These lessons carried over to my portfolio
        site, which I initially had no direction with. After planning my code
        out, I was able to add several elements that I couldn't quite wrap my
        head around before. After using Figma to create the mobile layout first,
        I found myself compromising a lot less with the design while adding more
        features, not taking them away.
