        <strong>As the first project I'd built for someone else,</strong> I was
        really excited about this one! I began this project when I had finished
        my first full course on HTML and CSS. My dad has needed a website for
        his computer repair/security camera installation business for quite some
        time, and I offered to put one together for him. I recently ran it past
        him and will be making some final changes to button everything up and
        enhance the mobile experience before publishing the site. This was also
        my first encounter with media queries - something I've improved at since
        this site, and this website was a great introduction to them.
      </p>

        Now that we're out of the winter season, I'll be heading out to a few of
        my dad's job sites to get photos of both the camereas and what they've
        captured to replace the dummy photos on the page. I'm excited to merge
        my passion for photography with my passion for web development, and this
        task will then wrap up the project. I also wrote the copy for this site,
        and I really enjoyed having creative freedom over each aspect of the
        site as my dad trusted me to take over the branding while making sure it
        fit with the direction he has in mind for his business.

        <strong>My biggest challenge</strong> with this site was making each
        section stand out without looking out of place, while also not repeating
        the previous sections. The layout is fairly simple, which can make it
        easy to become repetative. I decided to be mindful of the content
        heirarchy, use plenty of SVGs, and alter my text placement which all
        came together to make a cohesive website that I was happy with.

        <strong>The biggest challenge</strong> I encountered with this project
        was finally needing to debug. I would 'finish' a feature and it'd look
        great...for a few hours. Whether it was a miscalculation with the time
        conversion function I had written, or something in the API I hadn't
        accounted for, I found myself debugging often. And I loved it! I had so
        much fun creating this app, and I was excited any time I had the chance
        to re-write or simplify my code as it lead to me further understanding
        how all the moving parts interacted with (and sometimes broke) each
        other. This not only strengthened my ability to write new code, but also
        helped me to code cautiously so as to work in harmony with all of the
        other features within the app.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p6" class="paragraph-text">
        The other main challenge I faced was creating a pleasant UX on mobile
        devices. Auto-scrolling, keyboard pop-ups blocking elements, etc. all
        gave me the opportunity to brainstorm some new features to aid in a
        pleasant mobile experience. One example would be the page auto-scrolling
        when entering a city in the search bar. The keyboard would force the
        page to scroll down, which was fine, but it left the user at the bottom
        of the page after entering the search. Because of this, the user would
        then have to scroll back up to see the main weather display. I addressed
        this by adding a simple back-to-top function to the search icon. The
        result was a nice and smooth scroll that avoided hiding any information
        on the page. Tackling these problems to improve the UX felt great, and I
        was excited to see what other UX issues I could improve on.

        <strong>The biggest takeaway</strong> from this project was that I
        <em>can</em> do this. A lot of my fears and insecurities were squashed
        the second I cleared the tutorial code and began writing it out myself.
        I realized that I do understand how fetching APIs works, I can write my
        own functions that go beyond surface level, and that I am able to locate
        bugs and fix them myself. This boost in confidence led me to jump right
        into Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which I'm learning now.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p8" class="paragraph-text">
        One other takeaway was that planning is key. From using Figma to create
        a mockup for the layout to using flowcharts to plan the code out, I
        found the whole process to be much more manageable with this approach.
        Figma and flowcharts are now a part of each one of my new projects, and
        I find myself creating and learning much more efficiently while
        debugging far less often. These lessons carried over to my portfolio
        site, which I initially had no direction with. After planning my code
        out, I was able to add several elements that I couldn't quite wrap my
        head around before. After using Figma to create the mobile layout first,
        I found myself compromising a lot less with the design while adding more
        features, not taking them away.
