        <strong>As the first project I'd built for someone else,</strong> I was
        really excited about this one! I began this project when I had finished
        my first full course on HTML and CSS. My dad has needed a website for
        his computer repair/security camera installation business for quite some
        time, and I offered to put one together for him. I recently ran it past
        him and will be making some final changes to button everything up and
        enhance the mobile experience before publishing the site. This was also
        my first encounter with media queries - something I've improved at since
        this site, and this website was a great introduction to them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p2" class="paragraph-text">
        Now that we're out of the winter season, I'll be heading out to a few of
        my dad's job sites to get photos of both the cameras and what they've
        captured to replace the dummy photos on the page. I'm excited to merge
        my passion for photography with my passion for web development, and this
        task will then wrap up the project. I also wrote the copy for this site,
        and I really enjoyed having creative freedom over each aspect of the
        site as my dad trusted me to take over the branding while making sure it
        fit with the direction he has in mind for his business.

        <strong>My biggest challenge</strong> with this site was making each
        section stand out without looking out of place, while also not repeating
        the previous sections. The layout is fairly simple, which can make it
        easy to become repetative. I decided to be mindful of the content
        heirarchy, use plenty of SVGs, and alter my text placement which all
        came together to make a cohesive website that I was happy with.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p4" class="paragraph-text">
        Another challenge that I've since improved a great deal on was working
        with SVGs. While I knew the advantage of using them, I didn't realize
        they behaved differently than regular images. This resulted in countless
        hours of trial and error, and I finally did a deep drive into SVGs
        partway through this project which helped the rest of the build go much
        smoother. My dad needs this site up ASAP, so my goal once we deploy is
        to work on really buttoning up the hero background image.

        <strong>A big takeaway with from project</strong> was that I knew I had
        a lot to learn. I was very happy with how the website turned out, but I
        wanted to clean up my HTML and CSS, and I also knew I wanted to dive
        deeper into javascript to implement more features. This site, like my
        photography project, was built from desktop to mobile. This would be the
        last project that I would build in that order, now taking on a
        mobile-first build process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p8" class="paragraph-text">
        Another big takeaway stemmed from not having full control over the
        website. While I was given a lot of freedom to build it the way I had
        envisioned, my dad had asked me to change a handful of elements. This
        resulted in strucuring certain sections differently than what I was used
        to, and I found this to be very valuable as I really liked how some of
        those changes looked. I'm a strong advocate for working as a team and
        trying new things, and this project proved to reenforce those
        principles.
