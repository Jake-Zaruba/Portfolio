        <strong>This was by far my favorite project yet.</strong> With this
        website, my goal was to use only Vue.js to strengthen my understanding
        of it. It didn't take long for me to realize that I would absolutely
        love using Vue. After writing just a few lines of code, I couldn't
        believe how much time I had saved and how easy it was to manage all of
        the logic. Everything was so organized and easy to track, and the data
        binding made it so simple to make all of the inputs dynamic and
        interactive.

      <p id="p2" class="paragraph-text">
        Inititally, I was intimidated. I was using Vite for the first time as my
        bundler. I had a lot of new terms to learn. All of the building blocks -
        the html, CSS, and Javascript - were all in one component. I felt like I
        was starting over, but after a couple hours, it all clicked. I was able
        to build out the entire page faster than I ever had with vanilla
        Javascript.

      <br />
      <p id="p3" class="paragraph-text">
        Because Vue makes it so easy to add a lot of logic with less redundant
        code, I found myself spending way more time building and less time
        searching through loads of code to debug. Bugs were extremely easy to
        find, and any unwanted features were easy to correct. When I would think
        up a new feature to add, it was so easy to just begin creating it. Over
        the period of time that I worked on this site, I would stay up until
        3am-4am most nights because I was so excited to add new features, and it
        was so easy to do with Vue. I was already having so much fun on my
        journey of learning web development, but this project and framework took
        it to a whole new level, and I cannot wait to start creating something
        new.

        I was finally using many of the things I had <em>learned</em> but hadn't
        used in practice. Destructuring arrays and objects, looping through
        arrays, working with dates, times, and coordinates, and so much more. I
        really had to problem solve to create all of the features I wanted. This
        would result in periods of brainstorming before doing any actual coding,
        and intorduced me to flowcharts that I would use to plan out new
        features. Breaking the problems down this way made complicated features
        much easier to write out, and saved me from a lot of wasted time as
        opposed to my strictly trial and error approach I had been using up to
        this point.

        After a good amount of testing and debugging, my app was done. I decided
        to learn about PWAs and turned this app into one which I installed on my
        work computer as my new weather app. It was just a simple weather app,
        but I was so proud of what I had created. I couldn't wait for my next
        project, but I was now also well aware that I needed to begin learning a
        framework alongside my vanilla JS studies. I wanted to cut down on the
        boiler plate code and create code that would be reusable. I dove into
        Vue and Svelte and immediately understood the value they could bring to
        large scale projects.

        <strong>The biggest challenge</strong> I encountered with this project
        was finally needing to debug. I would 'finish' a feature and it'd look
        great...for a few hours. Whether it was a miscalculation with the time
        conversion function I had written, or something in the API I hadn't
        accounted for, I found myself debugging often. And I loved it! I had so
        much fun creating this app, and I was excited any time I had the chance
        to re-write or simplify my code as it lead to me further understanding
        how all the moving parts interacted with (and sometimes broke) each
        other. This not only strengthened my ability to write new code, but also
        helped me to code cautiously so as to work in harmony with all of the
        other features within the app.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p6" class="paragraph-text">
        The other main challenge I faced was creating a pleasant UX on mobile
        devices. Auto-scrolling, keyboard pop-ups blocking elements, etc. all
        gave me the opportunity to brainstorm some new features to aid in a
        pleasant mobile experience. One example would be the page auto-scrolling
        when entering a city in the search bar. The keyboard would force the
        page to scroll down, which was fine, but it left the user at the bottom
        of the page after entering the search. Because of this, the user would
        then have to scroll back up to see the main weather display. I addressed
        this by adding a simple back-to-top function to the search icon. The
        result was a nice and smooth scroll that avoided hiding any information
        on the page. Tackling these problems to improve the UX felt great, and I
        was excited to see what other UX issues I could improve on.

        <strong>The biggest takeaway</strong> from this project was that I
        <em>can</em> do this. A lot of my fears and insecurities were squashed
        the second I cleared the tutorial code and began writing it out myself.
        I realized that I do understand how fetching APIs works, I can write my
        own functions that go beyond surface level, and that I am able to locate
        bugs and fix them myself. This boost in confidence led me to jump right
        into Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which I'm learning now.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p id="p8" class="paragraph-text">
        One other takeaway was that planning is key. From using Figma to create
        a mockup for the layout to using flowcharts to plan the code out, I
        found the whole process to be much more manageable with this approach.
        Figma and flowcharts are now a part of each one of my new projects, and
        I find myself creating and learning much more efficiently while
        debugging far less often. These lessons carried over to my portfolio
        site, which I initially had no direction with. After planning my code
        out, I was able to add several elements that I couldn't quite wrap my
        head around before. After using Figma to create the mobile layout first,
        I found myself compromising a lot less with the design while adding more
        features, not taking them away.
