        <strong>This was by far my favorite project yet.</strong> With this
        website, my goal was to use only Vue.js to strengthen my understanding
        of it. It didn't take long for me to realize that I would absolutely
        love using Vue. After writing just a few lines of code, I couldn't
        believe how much time I had saved and how easy it was to manage all of
        the logic. Everything was so organized and easy to track, and the data
        binding made it so simple to make all of the inputs dynamic and
        interactive.

      <p id="p2" class="paragraph-text">
        Inititally, I was intimidated. I was using Vite for the first time as my
        bundler. I had a lot of new terms to learn. All of the building blocks -
        the html, CSS, and Javascript - were all in one component. I felt like I
        was starting over, but after a couple hours, it all clicked. I was able
        to build out the entire page faster than I ever had with vanilla
        Javascript.

      <br />
      <p id="p3" class="paragraph-text">
        Because Vue makes it so easy to add a lot of logic with less redundant
        code, I found myself spending way more time building and less time
        searching through loads of code to debug. Bugs were extremely easy to
        find, and any unwanted features were easy to correct. When I would think
        up a new feature to add, it was so easy to just begin creating it. Over
        the period of time that I worked on this site, I would stay up until
        3am-4am most nights because I was so excited to add new features, and it
        was so easy to do with Vue. I was already having so much fun on my
        journey of learning web development, but this project and framework took
        it to a whole new level, and I cannot wait to start creating something
        new.

        <strong>By far, the biggest challenge</strong> was the fact that I
        intentionally made this project from stratch with no possibility of
        finding a tutorial. I made sure that this was an original idea so that I
        would not have any help if I got stuck. There were a couple points where
        I'd spend an entire day going through my code over and over again,
        morning to night, with no progress. This of course was frustrating at
        the time, but I've found it to be the single best thing for helping me
        learn. The more I went through this and really absorbed what I was
        learning, the less I'd get stuck.

        Another big challenge I faced was finding decent APIs to use. This
        project motivated me to really dive into learning MySQL and MongoDB,
        because the lack of information in some of the APIs had me manually
        creating massive arrays to be able to retrieve information. The car
        model array in particular was such a big task that could have been
        finished in minutes had I known SQL. I'm excited to use this experience
        as motivation to learn relational and non-relational databases, and to
        use them in creating my own APIs for future projects.

        <strong>My main takeaway</strong> from this project was realizing how
        powerful frameworks can be. I have so many new ideas for projects that I
        want to create now that I've seen how easy data binding and
        interactivity are with Vue. It can be hard to see the purpose that
        frameworks serve when you haven't used one. Even with this small
        project, it saved so much time and improved readability. I can now see
        why a lot of companies require frameworks for their large projects. In
        my next project, I really want to take advantage of using multiple
        components.

        Another big takeaway was that I need to really focus on learning
        backend. A few issues I ran into wouldn't have been a problem if I had
        created my own server. I also would have benefitted greatly by creating
        my own APIs. I'm planning on making a single page site with a database
        and login authentication to cover a lot of these topics that I now know
        I want to learn as I continue to build with Vue. I was already having a
        lot of fun learning and building with vanilla JavaScript, and I'm now
        even more excited to continue growing as a developer.
